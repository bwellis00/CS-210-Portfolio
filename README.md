# CS-210 Portfolio

Project from SHU CS-210 Programming Languages


## [Project 1 - Chada Clocks](https://github.com/bwellis00/CS-210-Portfolio/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20Chada%20Clocks)

This is a program that displays the time in a 12-hour and 24-hour format. It allows the user to increment the hour, minute, and second.

I believe I handled the menu well as well as user input.

The most challenging for me, which I wasn't able to fully implement, was changing from AM to PM when the new day rolled over

I skills I used that will easily transfer over to other projects was athe ability to create seperate functions for different pieces of code. They can be accessed at different points in the program and it really makes the overall program more maintainable and readable.
